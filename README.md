# TurnaboutTools
Several tools for modifying the 3DS game "Dai Gyakuten Saiban: Naruhodō Ryūnosuke no Bōken"

## arcUnpack.py
Unpacks the Capcom ARC files used by DGS to a folder of the same name. It will also generate a manifest required by arcRepack detailing file order and compression level.

Syntax:

`python arcUnpack.py archive.arc`

## arcRepack.py
Repacks a folder containing the manifest generated by arcUnpack into a Capcom ARC file usable by DGS.

Syntax:

`python arcRepack.py folder`

## TEXporter

Extracts and re-inserts image data stored in Capcom TEX files.

Extract Syntax:

`TEXporter.exe e file.tex`

Insert syntax:

`TEXporter.exe i original_file.tex image.png`

Format 11 (0xB) uses ETC1 compression and as such currently relies on etc1tool from the Android SDK in order to function, I cannot redistribute it with my application, so you'll have to obtain it yourself.

You can find the Android SDK here:

http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

Once you have obtained a copy of etc1tool.exe simply place it in the same directory as TEXporter.exe
